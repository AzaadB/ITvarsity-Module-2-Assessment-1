                      <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                      <p1>
                        Gorillas are great terrestrial, herbivorous apes that live mainly in the tropical rainforests of equatorial Africa. 
                        The genus Gorilla is divided into two species, the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and four or five subspecies. 
                        The gorilla's DNA is very similar to that of humans, ranging from 95 to 99 depending on what it contains, 
                        making it our closest living relative after chimpanzees and chimpanzees. 
                        The gorilla is the largest of the living primates, measuring between 1.25 and 1.8 meters in length 
                        depending on species and sex, weighing between 100 and 270 kilograms for it, and with an arm span of up 
                        to 2. ,6 meters. They tend to live in groups, with leaders known as Silverbacks. 
                        The eastern gorilla differs from the western gorilla in darker coat color and slight morphological 
                        differences. Gorillas usually live 35 to 40 years in the wild.
