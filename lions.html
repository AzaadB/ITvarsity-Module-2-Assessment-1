                      <h3>LION</h3>
                      <p1>
                    Located in Africa and India, the lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the Panthera genus. 
                    There is a tuft of hair at the end of its tail, and its body is muscular and broad-chested; its head is round 
                    and short; and its ears are large. A male lion has a prominent mane and is sexually dimorphic; females do not. 
                    Groups of this species are called prides, and they live in social groups. 
                    A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 
                    Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been 
                    known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Lions live in grasslands, savannahs and scrublands. 
                    They are usually more diurnal than other wildcats, 
                    but become active at night and dusk when chased. 
                    During the Neolithic period, lions were distributed throughout Africa and Eurasia, from southeastern Europe to 
                    India, but have declined to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and to a single population in western 
                    India. . Since 1996, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as the population of African
                    countries has declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. 
                    Lion populations cannot be maintained outside of designated reserves. 
                    The cause of the decline is not fully understood, but concerns are about habitat loss and conflict with humans.
