                      <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                      <p1>
                    The giant panda (Ailuropodine melaleuca, panda bear or simply panda) is a species of bear endemic to China. 
                    It is characterized by its strong black and white coat and rounded body. 
                    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from its neighbour, the red panda. 
                    Although a member of the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a leaf-eater, 
                    with more than 99% of its diet consisting of bamboo shoots and leaves. 
                    In the wild, giant pandas can eat other grasses, wild tubers and even meat in the form of birds, 
                    rodents and carrion. In captivity, they can be fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges or 
                    bananas and a specially formulated diet.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Giant pandas live in several mountains in central China, mainly in Sichuan, 
                    but also in the neighboring provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. 
                    Giant pandas are an endangered species as agriculture, 
                    deforestation and other development activities have pushed them out of the lowlands where they once lived. 
                    Another 27 were found in captivity outside the country. As of December 2014, 
                    there are 49 giant pandas in 18 zoos in 13 countries outside of China. 
                    Wild population estimates vary. There are an estimated 1,590 individuals living in the wild, 
                    but his 2006 study using DNA analysis suggested the number could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.
                    By March 2015, the wild giant panda population had grown to 1,864 hectares. 
                    In 2016, pandas were listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, confirming decades of efforts to save pandas. 
                    In July 2021, the Chinese government also classified the giant panda as endangered.
