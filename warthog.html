                      <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p1>
                    The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the Porcidae family (Acanthidae) 
                    found in grasslands, savannas and forests in sub-Saharan Africa. 
                    Once considered a subspecies of P. aethiopcus, this scientific name is now restricted to the desert boar of 
                    northern Kenya, Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The warthog is a medium-sized species, 
                    with a body length of 0.9 to 1.5 m (2 ft 11 to 4 ft 11 in) and a shoulder height of 63.5 to 85 cm 
                    (25.0 to 5 in). (33.5 inches). Females are smaller at 45–75 kg (99–165 lb) and lighter than males, 
                    weighing 60–150 kg (130–330 lb). 
                    Warthogs can be identified by two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. 
                    The lower pair is much shorter than the upper pair and becomes razor sharp as it rubs against the upper pair 
                    each time the jaw opens and closes. The upper canines can be up to 25.5 cm (10.0 in) long, 
                    have a broad oval cross-section, about 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) wide. 
                    The tusks curve more than 90 degrees from the base and as they grow, they are slightly curved so they do not 
                    lie flat on the table. 
                    The tusks are not used for digging but are used to fight other pigs and defend themselves against predators. 
                    The lower canine can be seriously injured.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Warthog ivory is obtained from developing canines. Ivory, especially the top set, behaves like ivory, 
                    with all scale patterns. Ivory is mainly carved for tourism purposes in East and South Africa. 
                    Boars have a large head, mane extending from the spine to the middle of the back. 
                    Thin hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. 
                    The tail is long and ends in a bun. Boars lack subcutaneous fat and have sparse hair, 
                    making them vulnerable to extreme environmental temperatures.
