                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                            <p1>
                        Gemsbok are light brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. 
                        Amoungst the genus Oryx they are the largest species. At the shoulder they stand at 1.2m(4ft). Their body length
                        can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm (18 to 35 in). 
                        When it comes to the weight of a male gemsbok they weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb), as of a female gemsbok,
                        they can weigh between 100–210 kg (220–460 lb). A comparative comparison would be to compare the 
                        East African oryx with the Western oryx, there are less black patches on the legs (none on the hindlegs), 
                        and there is less black on the lower flanks. Gold oryx, one of the more rare color morphs, 
                        can have muted black markings that make the gemsbok appear golden. 
                        </p1>

                        <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E23, next to the outdoor restaurant.</p>
