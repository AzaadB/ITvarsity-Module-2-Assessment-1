                      <h3>KOALA</h3>
                      <p1>
                    The koala, or koala to be exact (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal and herbivorous marsupial native to 
                    Australia. 
                    It is the only extant member of the family Phascolarcidae, and its closest living relative is the koala. 
                    Koalas are found in the eastern and southern coastal areas of the continent and are found in Queensland, 
                    New South Wales, Victoria and southern Australia. It is easily recognized by its stocky, 
                    tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and a large spoon-shaped nose. 
                    Koalas range in size from 60 to 85 centimeters (24 to 33 inches) and weigh between 4 and 15 kilograms 
                    (9 to 33 pounds). Coat color ranges from silver gray to chocolate brown. Northern koalas are usually smaller and 
                    lighter in color than southern koalas.
                    These populations may be separate subspecies, but this is still controversial.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Koalas usually live in open eucalyptus forests, as eucalyptus leaves make up the bulk of their diet. 
                    This eucalyptus diet is low in nutrients and calories and contains toxins that prevent most other mammals 
                    from eating it. Koalas are mostly sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. 
                    They are sociable animals and the bond exists only between the mother and the dependent child. 
                    Adult males communicate with loud growls to intimidate rivals or attract mates. 
                    Males indicate their presence by secretions from the scent glands on their chest. 
                    As marsupials, koalas give birth to immature cubs, burrow into their mother's pouch, 
                    and spend the first six to seven months of their lives there. 
                    Called joeys, these koalas are about a year old and fully weaned. 
                    Koalas have few natural enemies or parasites, but are threatened by a variety of pathogens, 
                    including chlamydiaceae and koala retroviruses.

                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p> You will find the koalas at pen E26, right opposite the giraffes.</p>
