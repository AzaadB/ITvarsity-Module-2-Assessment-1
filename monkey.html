                      <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                      <p1>
                    Monkey is the common name for most of the mammals of the order Cymiformes, also known as monkeys. 
                    Traditionally, all modern apes have been included in apes, with the exception of great apes, 
                    which represent an incomplete paraphyletic group. However, 
                    the broad definition based on taxonomy also includes great apes (apes), 
                    so apes and apes are synonyms for this range. In 1812, Geoffroy united the apes and family Cercopithecidae, 
                    naming Catarlini, meaning "Old World monkey" ("Old World monkey" in French). 
                    The surviving sister of the catarrhalis ("Things") monkey is the platyrrini (New World monkey). 
                    About 9 million years before the divergence between Cercopithecidae and apes, 
                    platypuses appeared among Afro-Arab (Old World) "apes", possibly by sea migration to South America. 
                    Thus, gibbons are deep in the phylogenetic tree of extant and extinct apes, 
                    and each of these gibbons is clearly more closely related to Cercopithecidae than to Platyridae.

                    Many species of monkeys are arboreal, but some species, such as baboons, are primarily terrestrial. 
                    Most species are active mainly during the day (diurnal). Monkeys, especially Old World monkeys, 
                    are generally considered intelligent. In the order Haplorhini, the great apes are the sister group of the tarsier, 
                    and the two members split about 70 million years ago. 
                    New World monkeys and catarrhal monkeys appeared in the apes family about 35 million years ago. 
                    Old World monkeys and great apes evolved from catarrhal apes about 25 million years ago. 
                    The extinct basal apes such as Aegyptopithecus and Parapithecus (35â€“32 million years ago) are also considered by 
                    primates to be apes.
