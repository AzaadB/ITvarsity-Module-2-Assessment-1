                            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                            <p1>
                            Among all land animals, elephants are the largest. A bush elephant is a living species, 
                            a forest elephant is a living species, and an Asian elephant is a living species. Mammoths and 
                            mastodons are extinct relatives of Elephantidae and Proboscidea, they are the only surviving members.
                            Elephants are known for their pillar-like legs, long trunks, tusks, large ear flaps, and durable 
                            but sensitive grey skin. By using the trunk, the mouth is able to receive food and water, 
                            as well as grasp objects. Besides being weapons, tusks serve as tools for digging and moving objects. 
                            It is possible to maintain a constant body temperature and communicate with the assistance of the large 
                            ear flaps. A Asian elephant has a convex back and a smaller ear, 
                            whereas an African elephant has a concave back and a smaller ear. Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, 
                            and Southeast Asia are home to elephants, which live in a variety of habitats, such as savannahs,
                            forests, deserts, and marshes. In places where water is readily available, they stay near it.
                            Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight.
